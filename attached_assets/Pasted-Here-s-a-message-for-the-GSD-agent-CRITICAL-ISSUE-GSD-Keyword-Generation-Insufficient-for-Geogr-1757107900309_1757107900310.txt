Here's a message for the GSD agent:

CRITICAL ISSUE: GSD Keyword Generation Insufficient for Geographic Coverage

Problem:
BIS is sending GSD the proper inputs (8 Coachella Valley cities + HVAC industry) but GSD is only returning 3-5 keywords instead of the comprehensive geo-specific keyword list needed for proper market analysis. This is causing severely limited competitor discovery.

Evidence:

Direct CA diagnostic test proves: 3 keywords = 13 competitors, 5 keywords = 15 competitors
When CA runs independently with comprehensive keywords: 44 competitors found
When BIS uses GSD's limited keywords: Only 13-25 competitors found
CA diagnostic logs show only 22-23 SERP results total (should be 500+ for 8-city coverage)
Current Workflow:

BIS → GSD: cities: ["Palm Desert", "Palm Springs", "La Quinta", "Rancho Mirage", "Indian Wells", "Cathedral City", "Indio", "Desert Hot Springs"], industry: "HVAC"
GSD → BIS: Only 3-5 basic keywords (insufficient)
BIS → CA: Limited keywords → 13-15 competitors found
Expected Workflow:

BIS → GSD: City list + industry
GSD → BIS: 20+ comprehensive geo-specific keywords
BIS → CA: Full keyword set → 40+ competitors found
What GSD Should Generate:
For 8 cities × 15 HVAC service terms = 240+ keyword combinations:

"hvac repair Palm Desert", "hvac repair in Palm Desert"
"ac installation Palm Springs", "ac installation in Palm Springs"
"heating services La Quinta", "heating services in La Quinta"
Plus base industry terms: "hvac contractor", "emergency hvac"
Geographic radius terms: "hvac near Palm Desert", "hvac Coachella Valley"
Suggested Fixes:

Verify BIS input processing: Are you receiving the full city array from BIS?
Expand keyword generation: Combine each city with comprehensive HVAC service variations
Add geographic proximity terms: Include regional keywords for 15-25 mile radius coverage
Include search volume filtering: Return keywords with real traffic data
Increase keyword output: Target 200+ comprehensive combinations for 8-city markets
Request:
Please check your keyword generation logic when processing city arrays from BIS. The current output is treating this as a single-city analysis instead of comprehensive multi-city geographic coverage.

Can you verify what data you're receiving from BIS and confirm your keyword generation is creating comprehensive city × service combinations?

This should give the GSD agent exactly what they need to identify and fix the keyword generation issue.
