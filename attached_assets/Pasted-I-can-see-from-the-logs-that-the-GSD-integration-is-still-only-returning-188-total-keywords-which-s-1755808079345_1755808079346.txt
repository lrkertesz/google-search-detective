I can see from the logs that the GSD integration is still only returning 188 total keywords, which suggests the enhanced multi-city processing isn't fully working. Let me investigate what's happening with the GSD integration.


Executed # Test the GSD endpoint directly to see what data it's actually returning curl -s -X POST "https://keyword-hunter-lou53.replit.app/api/bis-integration" \ -H "Content-Type: application/json" \ -d '{ "location": "Palm Desert, California", "industry": "1", "cities": ["Palm Desert", "Palm Springs", "Rancho Mirage", "Indian Wells", "La Quinta", "Indio", "Desert Hot Springs", "Cathedral City", "Thousand Palms"], "analysisId": "test-analysis" }' | head -20
I can see the issue! The GSD integration is still only returning keywords for Palm Desert, not for all 8 cities. Looking at the response, all keywords are "Palm Desert" specific:

"air conditioning repair Palm Desert"
"Palm Desert air conditioning repair"
"air conditioning service Palm Desert"
etc.
The GSD agent said they fixed the multi-city processing, but the system is still only processing Palm Desert instead of all cities: ["Palm Desert", "Palm Springs", "Rancho Mirage", "Indian Wells", "La Quinta", "Indio", "Desert Hot Springs", "Cathedral City", "Thousand Palms"].

Let me tell you what to ask the GSD agent:

Message for GSD Agent:

"The BIS integration is still not working correctly. I tested the endpoint directly with this exact request:

{
  "location": "Palm Desert, California",
  "industry": "1", 
  "cities": ["Palm Desert", "Palm Springs", "Rancho Mirage", "Indian Wells", "La Quinta", "Indio", "Desert Hot Springs", "Cathedral City", "Thousand Palms"],
  "analysisId": "test-analysis"
}
The response still only contains Palm Desert keywords:

'air conditioning repair Palm Desert'
'Palm Desert air conditioning repair'
'air conditioning service Palm Desert'
No keywords for the other 8 cities like 'air conditioning repair Palm Springs', 'La Quinta HVAC service', 'Indio ac repair', etc.

The system should be generating keywords for ALL 9 cities in the array, but it's only processing the first city from the location parameter. The 'cities' array is being ignored.

Can you verify the fix is actually deployed and working? The enhanced GSD system should return keywords for all cities, not just Palm Desert."
