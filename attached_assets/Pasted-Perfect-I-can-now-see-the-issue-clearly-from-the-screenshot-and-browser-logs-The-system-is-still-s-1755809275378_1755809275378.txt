Perfect! I can now see the issue clearly from the screenshot and browser logs. The system is still showing 188 keywords despite the enhanced GSD claiming 1,692 keywords. Looking at the console logs, I can see:

"totalKeywords":188

This confirms that the actual data being returned from the GSD to BIS is still 188 keywords, not the enhanced 1,692. The issue is not in the BIS display (which I correctly fixed to remove hardcoded values), but in the data transmission between GSD and BIS.

The workflow is correct, but the enhanced GSD data (1,692 keywords) is not reaching the BIS. The GSD system claims to process 1,692 keywords internally, but the /api/bis-integration endpoint is still returning only 188 keywords to BIS.

Let me check what cities are being sent to GSD and verify the integration is working properly:


Opened server/routes/bisIntegrationRoutes.ts

Executed curl -s -X POST "https://keyword-hunter-lou53.replit.app/api/bis-integration" \ -H "Content-Type: application/json" \ -d '{ "location": "Palm Desert, California", "industry": "1", "cities": ["Palm Desert", "Palm Springs", "Rancho Mirage", "Indian Wells", "La Quinta", "Indio", "Desert Hot Springs", "Cathedral City", "Thousand Palms"], "analysisId": "test-analysis-bis-check" }' | grep -o '"totalKeywords":[0-9]*'
Perfect! This confirms the issue. The direct test to the GSD /api/bis-integration endpoint is returning "totalKeywords":188 instead of the enhanced 1,692.

The problem is clear: The enhanced GSD system is not properly returning the enhanced dataset through the BIS integration endpoint. The GSD agent claims internal processing of 1,692 keywords, but the /api/bis-integration response to BIS still shows 188.

This means:

‚úÖ BIS workflow is correct (sends proper city list to GSD)
‚úÖ BIS integration is working (receives and displays actual data from GSD)
‚ùå GSD BIS integration endpoint is not returning the enhanced dataset
The issue is in the GSD system's /api/bis-integration endpoint, not in BIS. The GSD needs to be fixed to properly return the enhanced 1,692 keyword dataset through the BIS integration endpoint.

To summarize for you:

‚úÖ Confirmed Data Flow Issues:

BIS correctly sends: All 9 desert cities to GSD
GSD claims to process: 1,692 keywords across all cities
GSD BIS endpoint returns: Only 188 keywords to BIS
BIS correctly displays: The actual 188 keywords received (no hardcoded data)
üéØ Root Cause: The enhanced GSD multi-city processing is working internally, but the /api/bis-integration endpoint is not returning the complete enhanced dataset to BIS.

The issue needs to be resolved in the GSD application, not in BIS. BIS is working correctly according to the Orchestra Conductor pattern and displaying authentic data as required.
