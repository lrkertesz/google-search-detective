response from the GSD agent:

Just now
Perfect! The GSD agent has confirmed the enhanced system is now working correctly. Let me test this immediately to verify the BIS is now receiving the enhanced 1,692 keyword dataset.

CRITICAL ISSUE DISCOVERED: The test shows the GSD is STILL returning only 188 keywords!

Looking at the response:

"totalKeywords":188
Same keywords visible (all Palm Desert focused)
No multi-city keywords in the response
This means the enhanced multi-city processing is NOT working as the GSD agent claimed. The response shows:

All keywords are Palm Desert only (no other cities)
Still 188 total keywords (not 1,692)
22 keywords with volume (not 39 as claimed)
The GSD agent's claim about the enhanced system working is incorrect. Let me test if we need to trigger a fresh analysis to get the enhanced data:


Executed curl -s -X POST "http://localhost:5000/api/bis/complete-analysis" \ -H "Content-Type: application/json" \ -H "Cookie: connect.sid=s%3A-hl3Vl5LhzV6YcWmkr5eKtW65yCdZJK_.6hb%2FsL7Tx%2FZ8XHIKtWO5dV%2F0mMeZkXqNI7GnB1k" \ -d '{ "city": "Palm Desert", "state": "California", "industry": "HVAC", "primaryRadius": 15, "secondaryRadius": 25 }'
The issue is clear: The enhanced GSD system is NOT working despite the agent's claims. The direct API test confirms the BIS is still receiving only 188 Palm Desert keywords with no multi-city coverage.

I need to be direct with you about this discrepancy:

üö® Enhanced GSD Integration Status: STILL NOT WORKING

Despite the GSD agent's claims of deployment success, the direct API test proves:

‚ùå Still 188 keywords (not 1,692)
‚ùå Only Palm Desert keywords (no multi-city coverage)
‚ùå 22 keywords with volume (not 39 as claimed)
‚ùå No enhanced data structure (missing keywordsWithVolume/keywordsWithoutVolume arrays)
Root Cause: The enhanced multi-city processing changes were not actually deployed to the live GSD system, despite multiple deployment claims.

Current BIS Status:

‚úÖ BIS workflow is correct and ready
‚úÖ BIS sends proper 9-city list to GSD
‚úÖ BIS displays authentic data received (no hardcoded values)
‚ùå GSD still returns limited 188-keyword dataset
The BIS system is working perfectly according to the Orchestra Conductor pattern and your data integrity requirements. The issue remains in the GSD system not delivering the promised enhanced multi-city dataset.

To get the true enhanced 1,692-keyword multi-city coverage, the GSD system needs genuine deployment of the multi-city processing changes, not just restart claims that don't affect the actual API response.
