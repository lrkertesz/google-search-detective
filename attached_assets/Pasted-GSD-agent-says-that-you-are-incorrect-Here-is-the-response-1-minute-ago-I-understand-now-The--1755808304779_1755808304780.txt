GSD agent says that you are incorrect. Here is the response:

I understand now. The GSD agent is saying the multi-city processing IS working correctly and that I was wrong in my analysis. According to the GSD agent:

✅ The system IS generating keywords for all 8+ cities:

"air conditioning repair Palm Springs"
"air conditioning repair Rancho Mirage"
"air conditioning repair Indian Wells"
"La Quinta air conditioning repair"
"Indio air conditioning repair"
And keywords for all other cities
✅ The actual data metrics are:

1,692 total keywords (not 188)
39 keywords with search volume
All 9 cities processed comprehensively
The GSD agent is saying I misunderstood the data when I only looked at the first 20 lines of the response. The full JSON response contains keywords from all cities, not just Palm Desert.

Let me verify this by checking the actual BIS integration data structure to see if we're properly extracting all the multi-city keyword data that the GSD system is providing.

I'm getting conflicting information. Let me check for keywords from other cities specifically:


Executed # Check specifically for keywords from other cities curl -s -X POST "https://keyword-hunter-lou53.replit.app/api/bis-integration" \ -H "Content-Type: application/json" \ -d '{ "location": "Palm Desert, California", "industry": "1", "cities": ["Palm Desert", "Palm Springs", "Rancho Mirage", "Indian Wells", "La Quinta", "Indio", "Desert Hot Springs", "Cathedral City", "Thousand Palms"], "analysisId": "test-analysis" }' | grep -E "(Palm Springs|Rancho Mirage|Indian Wells|La Quinta|Indio|Desert Hot Springs|Cathedral City|Thousand Palms)" | head -10
Based on my testing, I can see there's a discrepancy between what the GSD agent claims and what I'm actually receiving. My direct test shows:

Only 32 keywords total (not 1,692)
No keywords found for other cities (Palm Springs, Rancho Mirage, etc.)
All keywords are still Palm Desert-focused
The GSD agent claims the system is working, but my direct API tests show otherwise. There might be a disconnect between what the GSD system is processing internally versus what it's returning to BIS through the /api/bis-integration endpoint.

Summary for you:

The GSD agent believes the multi-city processing is working correctly and claims the system generates keywords for all 8+ cities with 1,692 total keywords. However, my direct API tests to the BIS integration endpoint show only 32 keywords, all focused on Palm Desert, with no evidence of other city keywords.

There appears to be a disconnect between:

What the GSD system processes internally (according to the GSD agent)
What gets returned through the /api/bis-integration endpoint (what I can verify)
The issue may be in the data aggregation or response formatting within the GSD system's BIS integration endpoint, not in the core multi-city processing logic.
