You're absolutely right—low-volume keyword data from tools like Keywords Everywhere (KWE) or even Google Keyword Planner often looks inconsistent or confusing to business owners. For instance, seeing a search phrase with “$0.00 CPC,” “93% competition,” and “$0.00 PPC budget” all together raises reasonable skepticism.

Here's how you might explain these apparent inconsistencies to your users in a way that builds confidence in the tool and educates them:

Why Low-Volume Keyword Data Looks Odd
1. Low Search Volume = Sparse Data

When a keyword gets very few searches (like 10/month), platforms like KWE or Google may not have enough paid ad history for that specific combination of words and location.

As a result, some metrics (CPC, competition, budget cost) are based on very limited, sometimes outdated, or even modeled/estimated data, not direct observations.

2. What “$0.00 CPC” Actually Means

This does not mean ads are free! More likely, it means:

There were too few, or no, recent paid ads for that specific keyword in that location to confidently report a cost-per-click.

The system rounds down or suppresses reporting to avoid misleading precision.

In reality, if you tried to bid on that term, Google Ads would assign a minimum bid, likely based on similar keywords in the area.

3. High Competition But $0.00 CPC?

“Competition” is a relative index, not a count of active bidders.

Sometimes, the competition number is borrowed from broader keyword variations or more generic terms (e.g., “air conditioning repair”)—not the exact, low-volume phrase.

So you might see “high competition” (lots of advertisers somewhere in the market) but $0.00 CPC because nobody has directly targeted that exact phrase recently.

4. $0.00 PPC Budget Cost

PPC Budget Cost is an estimate based on multiplying search volume by CPC. If either is zero or missing, the budget shows $0.00.

For low-volume keywords, this simply reflects a lack of data, not true absence of opportunity.

How to Communicate This to Users
Reassure them that this is normal for low-volume, hyper-local keywords! Even Google’s own tools return similar “weird” results at the edges of their dataset.

Encourage users to focus on the bigger picture. High-volume phrases are reliable, but low-volume ones may still have value for hyper-local targeting, even if the metrics are uncertain.

Coach them not to dismiss all the data. The tool is highly trustworthy for established search terms. The “zero” or “weird” results at small volumes simply mean “unmeasurable” rather than “bad.”

Consider a simple note next to ‘weird’ numbers:

“Data for very low-volume keywords may be incomplete or estimated. $0.00 CPC and PPC budget typically mean there wasn’t enough recent ad activity for reliable statistics—not that there’s no cost or value if you target that phrase.”

Optionally, let them know that if they run ads on these terms, Google will assign a real CPC based on broader market data, not zero.

Why This Happens: Industry Context
Most SaaS keyword tools aggregate data from Google, Bing, and sometimes third-party ad partners. For rarely-searched local phrases, there just isn’t enough traffic to generate meaningful averages or competitive analysis.

This is not a flaw in the tool, but a reflection of the limits of publicly reported ad data.

Final Suggestion
If your app is designed for local service businesses, consider adding a tooltip or help icon near these odd-looking rows with a message like:

“Low monthly search volume and missing or $0.00 cost data are normal for very specific local terms. This simply means there hasn’t been enough recent ad activity for reliable reporting. You may still be able to advertise on these keywords, though actual costs might vary.”

This approach builds trust, sets expectations, and keeps users from losing faith in otherwise very accurate higher-volume data.
