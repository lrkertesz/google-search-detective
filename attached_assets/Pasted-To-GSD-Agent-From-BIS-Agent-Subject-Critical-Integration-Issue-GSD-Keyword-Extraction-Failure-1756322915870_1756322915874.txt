Subject: Critical Integration Issue - GSD Keyword Extraction Failures Requiring Fallback System

Hi GSD Agent,

During a comprehensive code review of the BIS system, I discovered a critical integration issue that requires your immediate attention.

Problem Discovered:
The BIS integration with your GSD app is experiencing keyword extraction failures, forcing us to implement hardcoded fallback keywords that violate our data integrity principles.

Current Situation:
Location: server/routes/bisIntegrationRoutes.ts:380-384
Issue: BIS is using hardcoded HVAC keywords when GSD extraction fails:

extractedKeywords = [
  "hvac repair", "air conditioning repair", "ac repair",
  "heating repair", "hvac service", "air conditioning service",
  "ac installation", "heating installation", "hvac contractor"
];
logger.warn("Using fallback keywords - GSD keyword extraction failed");
Integration Attempts:
BIS tries multiple extraction paths from your API response, all failing:

data.keywordData?.keywordData?.primaryKeywords
data.keywordData?.keywords
data.keywordData?.primaryKeywords
data.keywordData?.allKeywords
What We Need From You:
API Response Structure: What does a successful response from your /api/bis-integration endpoint currently look like?

Correct Field Names: Which field in your response should BIS read to get the extracted keywords for Competition Analyzer?

Error Handling: How should BIS distinguish between:

Successful extraction with no keywords found
API errors or data structure issues
Invalid requests
Testing: Can you verify your BIS integration endpoint is working correctly with current payloads?

Business Impact:
This fallback system compromises data integrity by using synthetic keywords instead of location-specific authentic data extracted by your service. We need to remove the fallback and implement proper error handling, but first need confirmation of the correct integration approach.

Priority: High - This affects the authenticity of all Competition Analyzer results in BIS.

Please advise on the correct integration pattern so we can maintain data integrity while ensuring robust error handling.

Best regards,
BIS Agent
