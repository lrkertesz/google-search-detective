QUERRY: I am working on a research report that attempts tu determine the revenue potential in a gro-targeted market based on census data for the # of houses in the area.  This is for the HVAC industry.   Based on typical HVAC services, their annual occurrence vis integrating a life-cycle timing that triggers at service job need, the annual revenue potential for the most common HVAC service jobs in the market is $205MM/yr.  If we reduce that amount by 30% to account for people with annual maintenance contracts who would call their existing provider we gat an annual revenue opportunity of $145MM.     However, when we do an actual analysis of the keywords used to search for HVAC services in the market, we see that there are approximately 32,000 searches/yr.    If we apply "similar life cycle percentages to those annual searches .. we gat a revenue opportunity of $43MM.    So that's a $100MM Google gap.    Because searchers will use keyword terms that "describe the problem" thay are having ... it is difficult to determine using keywords "alone" what specific services they may ultimately need ... so we have to use a method like I described and "guess" or extrapolate.    For example, the term "ac blowing warm air" may be caused by a compressor fan failure, a needed refrigerant recharge or a complete system replacement. If I use the market revenue estimator app (based on housing data) we gat a "total" market opportunity based on life-cycle algorythms of $205MM. If we factor in that people with annual service/maint. contracts will call their existing vendor .. and not search Google ... and Perplexity estimates that only 30% of property owners have such contracts ... then we take 70% of $205MM .. we get around $143MM... If we try to use the keywords alone and extract from the 32,000 annual searches that 6.7% will need full system replacements, and then apply similar percentages of the 31K annual searches to the services .. we get $43MM available new revenue.  Although that is still a VERY substantial market opportunity, it's a significant difference... nearly $100MM. Any ideas on how we can resolve these two numbers and arrive at a figure we can support?  Is there a hybrid methodology I can develop.  I don't want to present research that has this big of a gap.

ANSWER:  To reconcile the discrepancy between your life-cycle (housing-based) market estimate and your keyword-driven revenue estimate for the HVAC industry, consider the following structured approach to create a defensible, hybrid methodology:

## 1. **Segment Why the Numbers Differ**

- **Top-Down Housing/Life-Cycle Approach** assumes 100% awareness and demand at the time of need—i.e., all eligible households will act when their system needs service, minus maintenance contract holders.
- **Bottom-Up Keyword/Search Approach** captures only those actively searching online—missing those who book directly, rely on referrals, or use provider apps.

### Why is the Google gap so large?
- **Not all HVAC demand is met via search:** Word-of-mouth, direct calls to known vendors, or brand loyalty can bypass Google.
- **Different stages of buyer journey:** Many “need” jobs are solved before search. Some searches are just exploratory, not immediate revenue opportunities.
- **Multiple searches per user:** Some individuals make several searches per incident (one job, many queries).
- **Service bundling:** A search may represent a smaller or larger basket of needs.
- **Missed “offline” intent:** Real service counts include offline behaviors Google can't see.

## 2. **Develop a Hybrid Model**

### A. **Calibrate Your Google Search Data Upwards**
- Estimate, via survey or industry data, what portion of all jobs start with a Google search. (E.g., if 32,000 searches represent 25% of all new jobs, scale up accordingly.)

### B. **Incorporate “Offline” and Non-Google Activity**
- Use industry reports or commission a survey to estimate:
  - Rate of direct repeat calls (no search)
  - Share of jobs arising from referrals, social media, or aggregator platforms

### C. **User Journey Mapping and Attribution**
- Assign an “average searches per job” rate—e.g., if a typical service call is preceded by 1.5 unique Google searches, then 32,000 / 1.5 ≈ 21,333 jobs.
- Align with the known ratio of service types triggered by search versus non-search (e.g., 6.7% system replacements in Google vs. total market)

## 3. **Construct a Defensible “Blended” Upside Scenario Table**

| Method                       | Est. Annual Revenue |
|------------------------------|--------------------|
| Life-cycle based (housing)    | $205MM             |
| Reduced for maintenance base  | $143MM             |
| Keyword-driven (search only)  | $43MM              |
| **Hybrid (adjusted)**         | TBD (see below)    |

**Adjust hybrid upwards:**
- If, for example, Google only represents 30% of all jobs (from external data), total searchable market revenue = $43MM / 0.3 ≈ $143MM, which aligns the methods.

## 4. **Recommendations for Your Report**

- **Explicitly acknowledge** the differences in methodology and explain why the gap exists (behavior, intent, journey, data source).
- **Use external benchmarks** (industry surveys, Google’s own industry reports, HVAC association stats) to justify your scaling factors or assumptions.
- **Propose a range** rather than a point estimate for the true annual revenue—e.g., “The Google-observable revenue opportunity is $43MM, but when accounting for all service triggers—including direct calls and referrals, as measured by life-cycle modeling and industry benchmarks—the full market is likely between $100MM and $150MM annually.”

### Example Hybrid Narrative

> While direct search-based lead generation captures approximately $43MM in observable annual opportunity, multiple studies show that only X% of HVAC jobs initiate online search. By calibrating search data upwards and factoring in non-digital triggers (referrals, scheduled service, repeat business), a more comprehensive estimate places true market potential between $100MM and $143MM per year. This range reconciles census-driven need with measured digital behavior, providing a robust estimate for market planning.

### **Final Tips**
- Try to collect supplemental data (surveys, industry reports, Google market insights) to benchmark the “search-to-job” ratio.
- Clearly state any estimation or extrapolation steps.

If you share your regional market or U.S.-wide data, I can help identify HVAC industry percentages for digital vs. offline service triggers and further refine your hybrid calculation.


MY RESPONSE:  I llike this hybrid approcah.. What I am trying to do is (1) give the HVAC biz owner some "reasonable" idea of the market size.  And also identify, with as much precision as possible, the share of the market that is addressible to them ... that's the Google search opportunity.   Althogh the methodology identifies a significant market segment ($100MM) than they may get a part of, they can't really do anything to influence word-of-mouth recommendations aside from their existing business practices.   Digital Marketng to increase local visibility may imrove "brand awareness" and give them a bigger share-of-mind in the word-of-mouth referral avenue,  using PPC campaigns to target specific keyword phrases getting actual search traffic gives then a direct and immediate path to get in fromt of people actually searching for their services.   So the baseline market (via Google search is $43MM ... and there is plenty of upside to address the $100MM brand awareness, word-of-mouth market via traditional sources (TV, radio, billboards, etc.)   What do you think about this approach?

AI's REPLY:  Your hybrid approach is both practical and strategically sound for presenting to HVAC business owners. Here are some key strengths and considerations to reinforce your methodology:

### 1. **Clear Market Segmentation**

- **Google Search-Driven Revenue ($43MM):**
  - This is a concrete, actionable segment. HVAC owners can directly compete for these customers via digital marketing such as PPC, SEO, and local listings.
  - It offers a tangible, measurable path to growth and allows the business owner to see the direct connection between marketing investment and potential revenue.

- **Broader Market Opportunity (Remaining $100MM):**
  - This segment reflects the larger ecosystem where jobs come from referrals, existing relationships, or brand recognition.
  - While less directly controllable, incremental share in this area can build over time via ongoing brand-building, reputation management, and general advertising.

### 2. **Actionable Recommendations**

- By **distinguishing between the search-addressable and the total market**, you empower business owners to align their investments and expectations.
- The $43MM Google-search opportunity sets a realistic baseline for what is *directly* addressable through digital strategies.
- The larger opportunity ($100MM+) emphasizes the value of broader marketing and reputation initiatives, but without misleading the owner into thinking those customers are easily captured by digital tactics alone.

### 3. **Supports Strategic Planning**

- Owners can set budgets and ROI expectations for digital campaigns (targeting the $43MM).
- Long-term planning (and higher-budget campaigns like TV, radio, OOH) can be justified as ways to build mindshare for the broader market, understanding these are less precise or immediate.

### 4. **Addresses What’s Controllable**

- Business owners often feel frustrated by “market size” numbers that don’t reflect what they can actually pursue. 
- By drawing a clear line between addressable (search-based) and non-addressable (referrals/loyalty), you focus their attention and resources where it matters most.

**Conclusion:**  
This approach provides HVAC business owners with:
- A defensible, data-backed figure for the *current, directly addressable* market ($43MM)
- Context for the *potential upside* with broader branding efforts ($100MM)
- A framework for allocating marketing resources efficiently

Presenting your findings this way is likely to earn buy-in and trust, enabling both tactical action and strategic vision as owners plan how to capture a larger share of their local market.
